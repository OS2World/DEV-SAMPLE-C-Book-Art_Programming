                                 Final Notes
                                 """""""""""

Because we did not explicitly state this in the first edition, many readers
misunderstood our intentions regarding the sample programs on the diskette.
Most error checking has been left out of the samples to avoid confusing the
reader with code that isn't necessarily relevant to the discussion concerning
any particular sample.

Also, we wish to express our deepest gratitude for your support of the book in
both editions.  Constantly we are being asked when this edition will be
released.  While the point is moot now, we wish to make it known that we were
painfully aware of the time it took to produce this work while many people
were anxiously awaiting its completion.

As it is stated in the book, we definately look forward to receiving feedback
from our audience.  Our electronic mail addresses are listed in the front
matter of the book; feel free to write and express yourself.

Thank you for your patience, and we sincerely hope that this book lives up to
your expectations.

Sincerely,
Arthur, Kathleen, and Larry
